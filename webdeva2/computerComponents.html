                    A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, 
                    is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program. The CPU performs 
                    basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the 
                    program. This contrasts with external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry, and specialized processors 
                    such as graphics processing units (GPUs).

                    A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to manipulate and alter memory to 
                    accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. GPUs are used in 
                    embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. Modern GPUs are efficient 
                    at manipulating computer graphics and image processing. Their parallel structure makes them more efficient than 
                    general-purpose central processing units (CPUs) for algorithms that process large blocks of data in parallel.

                    A motherboard (also called mainboard, main circuit board, mb, mboard, backplane board, base board, system board, 
                    logic board (only in Apple computers) or mobo) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in general-purpose computers
                    and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of 
                    a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals.
